class _points_to_volumes_function(Function):
    """
    For each point in a pointcloud, add point_weight to the
    corresponding volume density and point_weight times its features
    to the corresponding volume features.

    This function does not require any contiguity internally and therefore
    doesn't need to make copies of its inputs, which is useful when GPU memory
    is at a premium. (An implementation requiring contiguous inputs might be faster
    though). The volumes are modified in place.

    This function is differentiable with respect to
    points_features, volume_densities and volume_features.
    If splat is True then it is also differentiable with respect to
    points_3d.

    It may be useful to think about this function as a sort of opposite to
    torch.nn.functional.grid_sample with 5D inputs.

    Args:
        points_3d: Batch of 3D point cloud coordinates of shape
            `(minibatch, N, 3)` where N is the number of points
            in each point cloud. Coordinates have to be specified in the
            local volume coordinates (ranging in [-1, 1]).
        points_features: Features of shape `(minibatch, N, feature_dim)`
            corresponding to the points of the input point cloud `points_3d`.
        volume_features: Batch of input feature volumes
            of shape `(minibatch, feature_dim, D, H, W)`
        volume_densities: Batch of input feature volume densities
            of shape `(minibatch, 1, D, H, W)`. Each voxel should
            contain a non-negative number corresponding to its
            opaqueness (the higher, the less transparent).

        grid_sizes: `LongTensor` of shape (minibatch, 3) representing the
            spatial resolutions of each of the the non-flattened `volumes`
            tensors. Note that the following has to hold:
                `torch.prod(grid_sizes, dim=1)==N_voxels`.

        point_weight: A scalar controlling how much weight a single point has.

        mask: A binary mask of shape `(minibatch, N)` determining
            which 3D points are going to be converted to the resulting
            volume. Set to `None` if all points are valid.

        align_corners: as for grid_sample.

        splat: if true, trilinear interpolation. If false all the weight goes in
            the nearest voxel.

    Returns:
        volume_densities and volume_features, which have been modified in place.

    Add a batch of point clouds represented with a `Pointclouds` structure
    `pointclouds` to a batch of existing volumes represented with a

    More specifically, the method casts a set of weighted votes (the weights are
    determined based on `mode="trilinear"|"nearest"`) into the pre-initialized
    `features` and `densities` fields of `initial_volumes`.

    The method returns an updated `Volumes` object that contains a copy
    of `initial_volumes` with its `features` and `densities` updated with the
    result of the pointcloud addition.

    Example:
        ```

                of its floating point coordinate. The weights are
                determined using a trilinear interpolation scheme.
